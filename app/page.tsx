              With a passion for <b>teaching, culture, and community-building</b>, we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access <b>quality education and cultural activities</b>. 
              <br/><br/>
              After months of hard work, we were proud to become a <b>registered charity on 9th September 2024</b>, marking a significant step in our journey.
