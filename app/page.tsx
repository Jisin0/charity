            <h2>Our Mission üéØ</h2>
            <p>
              Our mission At <b>Slovensk√© Vzdel√°vacie Centrum ‚Äì South Manchester</b> goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to <b>keep our heritage alive</b>, to ensure that children growing up abroad don‚Äôt lose their <b>connection to their roots</b>, and to create a <b>place where Slovak culture thrives</b>‚Äîeven far from home. 
              <br/><br/>
              We believe that language is more than just words; it carries <b>identity, history, and a sense of belonging</b>. Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together, helping them <b>build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while living in the UK</b>. 
              <br/><br/>
              Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further. We are here to <b>bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems</b>, ensuring that children who may one day return to Slovakia can transition smoothly. 
              We are here to <b>support families, guide them, and make sure no one feels lost when navigating life between two countries</b>. 
              <br/><br/>
              Above all, we are here to create a community‚Äîone that welcomes, supports, and celebrates <b>Slovak language, traditions, and the people who cherish them</b>.

            <p>
              Slovensk√© Vzdel√°vacie Centrum - South Manchester was founded by a group of <b>dedicated teachers</b> who shared a <b>common vision</b>‚Äîto establish a <b>Slovak educational and cultural centre</b> that truly makes a difference.
              <br/><br/>
              With a passion for <b>teaching, culture, and community-building</b>, we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access <b>quality education and cultural activities</b>. 
              <br/><br/>
              After months of hard work, we were proud to become a <b>registered charity on 9th September 2024</b>, marking a significant step in our journey. Our <b>official launch on 15th September</b> was a proud moment, celebrated in collaboration with the <b>Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela</b> and the <b>Association of Slovak Schools and Community Centres</b> in the UK. 
              <br/><br/>
              Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting <b>Slovak-speaking families, students, and individuals</b> who wish to <b>learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture</b> together.
