      At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we divide our academic year into four terms: Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer. This structure allows us to build learning themes and activities around seasonal and cultural events, while also ensuring alignment with South Manchester (Trafford Council) school holidays.

We offer Saturday Slovak language lessons at two locations:

📍 Morning (AM) Sessions: 10:00 – 12:00 at The Firs Primary School 📍 Afternoon (PM) Sessions: 14:00 – 16:00 at Sale High School

Although we primarily serve South Manchester, we welcome students from all areas.
